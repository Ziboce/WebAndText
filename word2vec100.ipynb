For reasons of legal certainty, while avoiding\\n', 'conflicts with existing performance frameworks of the different programmes, performance terminology, in\\n', 'particular output and results, should be defined.\\n', '(24) In light of the horizontal gender mainstreaming goal, targets for monitoring climate spending and performance and\\n', 'expenditure contributing to halting and reversing the decline of biodiversity, specific performance indicators for the\\n', 'budget should be introduced to track the spending on gender equality, as well as on climate change mitigation and\\n', '(12) Regulation (EU) 2021/2116 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 2 December 2021 on the financing, management and\\n', 'monitoring of the common agricultural policy and repealing Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013 (OJ L 435, 6.12.2021, p. 187).\\n', 'ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2024/2509/oj 3/239EN\\n', 'OJ L, 26.9.2024\\n', 'adaptation and the protection of biodiversity.

In particular, in order to effectively prevent, detect, investigate and correct frauds\\n', 'or remedy irregularities, it is necessary to be able to identify the natural persons that ultimately benefit, directly or\\n', 'indirectly, from Union funding or the misuse of that funding. The electronic recording and storage of data on\\n', 'recipients of Union funds, including their beneficial owners as defined in Article 3, point (6), of Directive (EU)\\n', '2015/849 of the European Parliament and of the Council (14), and the regular making of those data available in\\n', 'a single integrated and interoperable information and monitoring system, including a single data-mining and\\n', 'risk-scoring tool (single integrated IT system) provided by the Commission should facilitate risk assessment for the\\n', 'purposes of selection, award, financial management, monitoring, investigation, control and audit and contribute to\\n', 'effective prevention, detection, correction and follow-up of irregularities including fraud, corruption, conflicts of\\n', 'interest and double funding.

It should\\n', 'only use risk indicators that are objective, proportionate, necessary for risk assessment, as well as based on reliable\\n', 'sources of up-to-date information and data, in real time where feasible. The single integrated IT system should be\\n', 'designed for its use in line with general data protection principles, including data minimisation and storage\\n', 'limitation, applicable to the processing of personal data.\\n', '(32) For the purpose of ensuring that the functions of the single integrated IT system remain of a high standard, certain\\n', 'actions and measures should be implemented where feasible, including alignment of data fields with the relevant\\n', 'national and Commission IT systems and databases, with necessary additions for the purpose of the data-mining and\\n', 'risk-scoring tool, including reference to the unique identifier of the operations; integration of the relevant national IT\\n', 'systems and databases with the single integrated IT system for an automatic exchange of information; providing\\n', 'users with the possibility to tailor and group risk indicators and their weights to the needs and specificities of\\n', 'a Union fund, programme or country; use of artificial intelligence for analysing and interpreting data; providing\\n', 'users with multiple possibilities for using search options and filtering capabilities; providing users with guidance on\\n', 'the interpretation and use of data and results; and training on how to navigate the single integrated IT system, assess\\n', 'risks and take them into account in verifications and audits.\\n', '(33) In accordance with the principle of transparency enshrined in Article 15 TFEU, Union institutions are to conduct\\n', 'their work as openly as possible. With regard to budget implementation, the application of that principle implies\\n', 'that citizens should know where, and for what purpose, funds are spent by the Union. Such information fosters\\n', 'democratic debate, contributes to the participation of citizens in the Union’s decision-making process, reinforces\\n', 'institutional control and scrutiny over Union expenditure, and contributes to boosting its credibility.\\n', 'Communication should be more targeted and should aim to increase the visibility of the Union contribution for\\n', 'citizens. Such objectives should be achieved by the publication, preferably using modern communication tools, of\\n', 'relevant information concerning all recipients of funds financed from the budget which takes into account those\\n', 'recipients’ legitimate interests of confidentiality and security and, as far as natural persons are concerned, their right\\n', 'to privacy and the protection of their personal data. Union institutions should therefore adopt a selective approach\\n', 'in the publication of information, in accordance with the principle of proportionality. Decisions to publish should\\n', 'be based on relevant criteria in order to provide meaningful information.\\n', '(34) Without prejudice to the rules on the protection of personal data, the utmost transparency regarding information on\\n', 'recipients should be sought. The information on recipients of Union funds should be published on a centralised and\\n', 'dedicated website of Union institutions, such as the Financial Transparency System, and should be easily available via\\n', 'suitable and secure technical solutions.

Financial backing\\n', 'provided to such private-law bodies by a Member State in accordance with existing requirements set out in Union\\n', 'law, in a form decided by that Member State and not necessarily requiring a bank guarantee, should be considered as\\n', 'adequate financial guarantees.\\n', '(36) Personal data referring to natural persons should not be publicly available for longer than the period during which\\n', 'the funds are being used by the recipient and should therefore be removed after two years.\\n', '(37) In most of the cases covered by this Regulation, the publication concerns legal persons.
